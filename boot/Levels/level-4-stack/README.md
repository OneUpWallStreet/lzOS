Basic code demonstrating how the stack works in x86 architecture assembly.


### Why does mov al, [0x8000] not work?

The issue with the instruction `mov al, [0x8000]` not working as expected in your assembly code is likely due to the way the x86 architecture handles memory access and the current state of the stack pointer (`sp`).

Here are some points to consider:

1. **Segmentation and Offsets**: In real mode on x86 architectures, memory addresses are calculated using segment and offset pairs. The `mov al, [0x8000]` instruction uses the current data segment (`ds`) as the base, and `0x8000` as the offset. If `ds` is not set properly, the physical address accessed will not be `0x8000` but `ds:0x8000`, which might not point to the intended location.

2. **Stack Pointer Manipulation**: You've set the stack pointer (`sp`) to `0x8000`. When you push values onto the stack, the stack grows downwards, meaning that pushing 'A', 'B', and 'C' would result in them being placed at `0x8000 - 1`, `0x8000 - 2`, and `0x8000 - 3`, respectively. Therefore, trying to access `0x8000` immediately after these pushes would not refer to the top of the stack but to uninitialized or unrelated memory content.

3. **Accessing the Stack**: When you access `0x7FFE`, you are correctly reading the second byte on the stack (since each push of a character reduces `sp` by one). However, when you access `0x8000`, it's either pointing to an uninitialized area (as explained above) or it's getting affected by the segment base (`ds`).

4. **Pop Instructions**: The `pop bx` instructions work correctly because they inherently access the stack relative to the stack segment (`ss`) and `sp`, retrieving the values pushed earlier.

5. **Memory Permissions**: Depending on the environment or the operating system you're running this code on, certain memory addresses, including `0x8000`, might be protected or reserved, leading to unexpected behavior when you try to access them directly.

To fix this, you should either correctly calculate the physical address you want to access by accounting for the `ds` segment or manipulate the `sp` and `ss` to ensure you are accessing the intended memory area. Additionally, ensure that the memory address you are trying to access is not protected or restricted by the system you are running the code on.

### Shouldn't it point to A? It's at the top of the stack. How is it uninitialized?

Certainly, let's delve into the details of how the stack works and what happens when you manipulate the stack pointer (`sp`) and push data onto the stack, especially in the context of your code.

### Understanding the Stack

1. **Stack Basics**:
   - The stack is a Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) structure.
   - In x86 real mode, the stack grows downwards in memory. This means when you push a value onto the stack, the stack pointer (`sp`) is decremented.

2. **Your Stack Setup**:
   - You set `bp` (base pointer) and `sp` (stack pointer) to `0x8000`. Initially, `sp = 0x8000`.

3. **Push Operations**:
   - When you `push 'A'`, the ASCII value of 'A' (0x41) is placed on the stack. The stack pointer is decremented by 1 (since 'A' is 1 byte), so `sp` now points to `0x7FFF`.
   - Repeating with `push 'B'` and `push 'C'` places these characters at `0x7FFE` and `0x7FFD`, respectively, with `sp` pointing to `0x7FFD` after the last push.

### Analyzing the Problematic Instruction

- When you attempt to execute `mov al, [0x8000]`, you are trying to read a byte from the memory address `0x8000`.

- Given the stack operations you've performed, let's see what is likely at `0x8000`:
  - Before any push operations, `sp` was at `0x8000`. This address was the top of the stack, but nothing had been pushed to it yet.
  - After pushing 'A', 'B', and 'C', the stack filled the addresses `0x7FFF`, `0x7FFE`, and `0x7FFD`, respectively.
  - `0x8000` itself was never written to; it was just the initial point where `sp` was set. Therefore, it remains uninitialized in the context of your stack operations.

### Conclusion

- The reason `mov al, [0x8000]` does not work as expected is that `0x8000` doesn't point to 'A' or any of the pushed characters. Instead, it's an address that was never modified by your push operations and thus contains whatever value was previously there in memory.

- If you wanted to access 'A', you would need to adjust the offset to where 'A' was actually pushed, which would be `0x7FFF`, not `0x8000`. 

This explains why accessing `0x8000` might seem like it's reading from an uninitialized or unrelated memory area in the context of your stack manipulation.
