This is simply code designed to demonstrate how to use functions and print within functions/code. Additionally, we utilize commands such as `pusha` and `popa` to save the state of registers.

The other two functional files are responsible for printing strings and printing hex values with BIOS.

This is my conversation with GPT-4, aiming to understand the `print_hex` function.

### How does print_hex work? 

This `print_hex` subroutine is an assembly routine that takes a 16-bit number in the `dx` register, converts it to a hexadecimal string representation, and prints it. Here's a step-by-step explanation of how the subroutine works:

1. **Prologue**:
    ```asm
    pusha
    ```
    This instruction (`pusha`) pushes all general-purpose registers onto the stack to preserve their state. This is a common practice in subroutine calls to prevent changes to the registers that the caller might be using.

2. **Initialization**:
    ```asm
    mov cx, 0 ; our index variable
    ```
    `cx` is initialized to 0 and will be used as an index variable in the loop to process each of the four hexadecimal digits.

3. **Hexadecimal Conversion Loop (`hex_loop`)**:
    ```asm
    cmp cx, 4 ; loop 4 times
    je end
    ```
    The loop is set to run 4 times since we want to process each of the 4 digits in a 16-bit number (each hexadecimal digit represents 4 bits).

4. **Extract and Convert Last Hex Digit**:
    ```asm
    mov ax, dx
    and ax, 0x000f ; 0x1234 -> 0x0004
    add al, 0x30 ; convert to ASCII
    cmp al, 0x39
    jle step2
    add al, 7 ; adjust for 'A' to 'F'
    ```
    This section extracts the least significant hex digit (4 bits) of `dx` by masking the higher bits with `0x000f`. Then it adds `0x30` to convert it into an ASCII character (for digits `0`-`9`). If the result is greater than `0x39` (ASCII for `9`), it's a letter (`A`-`F`), so it adds 7 more to get the correct ASCII value (`0x41`-`0x46`).

5. **Store Converted Digit in String**:
    ```asm
    mov bx, HEX_OUT + 5 ; base + length
    sub bx, cx  ; our index variable
    mov [bx], al ; copy the ASCII char to bx
    ```
    Here, `bx` is set to point to the end of the `HEX_OUT` string, and then it's decremented by the index `cx` to point to the correct position where the converted ASCII character should be stored.

6. **Rotate `dx` for Next Digit**:
    ```asm
    ror dx, 4 ; rotate right by 4 bits
    ```
    The `ror` instruction rotates `dx` right by 4 bits, which brings the next hex digit to the least significant position for processing in the next iteration of the loop.

7. **Looping**:
    ```asm
    add cx, 1
    jmp hex_loop
    ```
    The index `cx` is incremented, and the program jumps back to the start of the `hex_loop` to process the next digit.

8. **End of Loop**:
    ```asm
    end:
    ```
    This label marks the end of the loop.

9. **Printing the Hexadecimal String**:
    ```asm
    mov bx, HEX_OUT
    call print
    ```
    After converting all digits, `bx` is loaded with the address of the `HEX_OUT` string, and the `print` subroutine is called to print the string.

10. **Epilogue**:
    ```asm
    popa
    ret
    ```
    The `popa` instruction restores the state of the general-purpose registers, and `ret` returns control to the caller.

11. **Hexadecimal Output String**:
    ```asm
    HEX_OUT:
    db '0x0000',0 ; reserve memory for our new string
    ```
    `HEX_OUT` is the memory location reserved for the hexadecimal string. It is initialized with `0x0000` and a null terminator (`0`) to denote the end of the string.

This routine takes a 16-bit value in `dx`, converts it to a hexadecimal string (like `0x1234`), and then prints it to the screen using BIOS interrupts or another printing mechanism not shown in this snippet.

### Explain Step 1 in Detail 

Of course, let's break down the process step by step in simpler terms:

Assume `dx` has the value `0x1234`. You want to convert this hexadecimal value into ASCII characters so it can be displayed as a string of text, like "1234".

1. **Copy `dx` to `ax`**:
    ```asm
    mov ax, dx
    ```
    This copies the contents of `dx` into `ax`. Now both `ax` and `dx` have the value `0x1234`.

2. **Mask the Higher Bits**:
    ```asm
    and ax, 0x000f
    ```
    The `AND` operation here is used to keep only the last hexadecimal digit of `ax`. The value `0x000f` is a mask that when `AND`ed with `0x1234` will result in `0x0004`. This is because in binary, `0x000f` is `0000 0000 0000 1111`, and when you `AND` it with `0x1234` (`0001 0010 0011 0100`), only the last four bits (one hexadecimal digit) remain, which are `0100` (binary for `4`).

3. **Convert to ASCII**:
    ```asm
    add al, 0x30
    ```
    Each digit in hexadecimal (0-9 and A-F) has an equivalent ASCII code. For the digits `0` through `9`, their ASCII codes are `0x30` through `0x39`. So to convert the number `4` into its ASCII equivalent, you add `0x30` to it (`0x04 + 0x30 = 0x34`), which is the ASCII code for the character '4'.

4. **Check If It's a Letter**:
    ```asm
    cmp al, 0x39
    jle step2
    ```
    This part checks if the ASCII code in `al` is greater than `0x39`. If it is not (meaning `al` is between `0x30` and `0x39`), it's already a valid ASCII code for the digits `0` through `9`, and no further action is needed, so it jumps to `step2`. If `al` is greater than `0x39`, it means that the original hexadecimal digit was between `A` and `F`, and we need to adjust it to the correct ASCII code.

5. **Adjust for Letters A-F**:
    ```asm
    add al, 7
    ```
    If the digit was a letter (`A`-`F`), we need to add 7 more to the value in `al` to get the correct ASCII code. This is because there's a gap of 7 ASCII codes between `9` (`0x39`) and `A` (`0x41`). So, if `al` was `0x3A` (which is `:` in ASCII), adding `0x07` would turn it into `0x41`, which is the ASCII code for `A`.

By repeating this process four times (once for each of the four digits in `0x1234`), you get the ASCII representation of each digit, which can then be put together as a string like "1234" and printed out as text.

### Explain Step2 in Detail 

Sure, let's go through the `step2` section of the code and understand it in detail:

The goal of this step is to place the ASCII character, which represents a single hexadecimal digit, into the correct position in the output string `HEX_OUT`.

1. **Calculate Position in Output String**:
    ```asm
    mov bx, HEX_OUT + 5 ; base + length
    sub bx, cx          ; our index variable
    ```
    - `HEX_OUT + 5` calculates the address that is 5 bytes past the start of the `HEX_OUT` string. Since `HEX_OUT` is defined as a string with a length of 5 characters (`'0x0000'` plus a null terminator), `HEX_OUT + 5` points to the null terminator at the end of the string.
    - `sub bx, cx` subtracts the current loop index (stored in `cx`) from this address. Since we start with `cx` equal to 0 and increment it with each iteration, subtracting `cx` moves `bx` leftward one position at a time, starting from the end of the string.

2. **Store ASCII Character**:
    ```asm
    mov [bx], al ; copy the ASCII char on 'al' to the position pointed by 'bx'
    ```
    This line stores the ASCII character from `al` into the memory location pointed to by `bx`. On the first iteration of the loop, `cx` is 0, so `bx` will be pointing at the null terminator. The ASCII character is placed there, and the null terminator is overwritten. That's okay because we will put it back at the end of the string when all characters are processed.

3. **Rotate `dx` to Process Next Digit**:
    ```asm
    ror dx, 4 ; rotate right by 4 bits
    ```
    The `ror` instruction rotates the contents of the `dx` register 4 bits to the right. This means that the next hexadecimal digit to be processed is moved into the least significant digit's position. If `dx` was `0x1234` before the rotation, it becomes `0x4123` after. On the next loop iteration, the `3` will be processed.

By repeating this loop four times, each of the four hexadecimal digits is processed in reverse order (from least significant to most significant). The `sub bx, cx` line ensures that each digit is placed in the correct position in the output string.

So, for an input of `0x1234`, the output string `HEX_OUT` is filled like this:

- First iteration: `HEX_OUT` becomes `'0x0004'`
- Second iteration: `HEX_OUT` becomes `'0x0034'`
- Third iteration: `HEX_OUT` becomes `'0x0234'`
- Fourth iteration: `HEX_OUT` becomes `'0x1234'`

At the end of the loop, `HEX_OUT` contains the full ASCII representation of the original hexadecimal number, and the subroutine can call another routine to print this string to the screen or handle it as needed.

## Walk Through The 4 Iterations 

Certainly! Let's walk through the four iterations of the loop and see how each hexadecimal digit from `dx` (which we'll assume starts as `0x1234`) is converted to its ASCII representation and placed into the `HEX_OUT` string.

Firstly, let's establish that `HEX_OUT` is a memory location that has been reserved to hold our output string. The `mov [bx], al` instruction is actually moving data into the memory location pointed to by `bx`, which corresponds to a position within `HEX_OUT`.

Now, let's go through the iterations:

### Before Starting the Loop
The `HEX_OUT` memory initially contains the string `'0x0000'`, and a null terminator that we are not representing here for simplicity.

### Iteration 1:
1. `dx` register contains `0x1234`.
2. Mask the last digit with `and ax, 0x000f`, resulting in `0x0004`. The ASCII conversion of `4` is done.
3. `cx` is `0` (as this is the first iteration), so `HEX_OUT + 5 - cx` points to the end of `'0x0000'`, just before the null terminator.
4. The ASCII character `'4'` is placed into this position, turning `HEX_OUT` into `'0x0004'`.
5. `dx` is rotated right by 4 bits, resulting in `0x4123`.

### Iteration 2:
1. `dx` now contains `0x4123`.
2. Mask the last digit with `and ax, 0x000f`, resulting in `0x0003`. The ASCII conversion of `3` is done.
3. `cx` is `1`, so `HEX_OUT + 5 - cx` points to the second-to-last character of `'0x000'`.
4. The ASCII character `'3'` is placed into this position, turning `HEX_OUT` into `'0x0034'`.
5. `dx` is rotated right by 4 bits, resulting in `0x3412`.

### Iteration 3:
1. `dx` now contains `0x3412`.
2. Mask the last digit with `and ax, 0x000f`, resulting in `0x0002`. The ASCII conversion of `2` is done.
3. `cx` is `2`, so `HEX_OUT + 5 - cx` points to the third-to-last character of `'0x00'`.
4. The ASCII character `'2'` is placed into this position, turning `HEX_OUT` into `'0x0234'`.
5. `dx` is rotated right by 4 bits, resulting in `0x2341`.

### Iteration 4:
1. `dx` now contains `0x2341`.
2. Mask the last digit with `and ax, 0x000f`, resulting in `0x0001`. The ASCII conversion of `1` is done.
3. `cx` is `3`, so `HEX_OUT + 5 - cx` points to the fourth-to-last character of `'0x0'`.
4. The ASCII character `'1'` is placed into this position, turning `HEX_OUT` into `'0x1234'`.
5. `dx` would be rotated again, but since this is the last iteration, the loop ends.

Now `HEX_OUT` contains the string `'0x1234'`, which is the ASCII representation of the hexadecimal value we started with. It's important to note that `HEX_OUT` started as `'0x0000'` and through each iteration, a new character was placed in the correct position, building up the string from right to left. Each `mov [bx], al` instruction writes a character into the memory space reserved for `HEX_OUT`, and `bx` is used to address the correct position within this space.


### What is Carriage Return

The concept of a "carriage return" originates from the days of typewriters. Here's a detailed explanation:

### Typewriter Analogy
On a typewriter, typing occurs on a movable part called the "carriage." As you type, the carriage moves from left to right. At the end of a line, to start a new line, you would do two things:

1. **Line Feed (LF)**: Move the paper up one line – this is analogous to the newline (`\n` or ASCII `0x0A`) in text.
2. **Carriage Return (CR)**: Return the carriage to the leftmost position – this is the carriage return (`\r` or ASCII `0x0D`) in text.

### In Computers
In computer systems, the carriage return and line feed have been adopted to control the position of the "cursor" on the screen or to manage the layout of text data in files:

- **Carriage Return (`\r` or `0x0D`)**: Moves the cursor to the beginning of the current line. It does not advance to the next line; it just returns to the start of the current line. This can overwrite the existing text if anything is typed afterward.
- **Line Feed (`\n` or `0x0A`)**: Moves the cursor down to the next line but does not move it back to the start of the line. If the cursor is not at the beginning of the line when the line feed is executed, the next characters will be placed at the same horizontal position in the next line.

### Operating System Differences
Different operating systems have different conventions for new lines in text files:

- **Unix and Unix-like Systems (Including Linux and macOS)**: Use just the line feed character (`\n`) to denote a new line.
- **Windows**: Uses both a carriage return and a line feed (`\r\n`) to denote a new line.
- **Old Macintosh Systems (pre-OS X)**: Used just the carriage return character (`\r`) to denote a new line.

### In Your Bootloader
In the context of your bootloader, when you print text to the screen via BIOS interrupts, you must manually control the cursor position. So, after printing a line of text, you use:

- `0x0A` to move the cursor down to the next line (line feed).
- `0x0D` to move the cursor all the way to the left of the screen (carriage return).

This ensures that the next characters you print will start at the first position of the next line on the screen, which is the standard behavior for starting a new line in most text output environments.
