# Boot Sector

The primary boot code for this operating system will reside in this directory. Currently, I am examining the boot sector at various levels, gaining an understanding of x86 architecture and how to write low-level code. 

The code for these levels will serve as an artifact of my learning process, while the main code will also be located in this directory as we progress.
