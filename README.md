Took an OS course covering all theoretical concepts and explored higher-level implementations of Virtual Memory, Paging, etc. However, to deepen my understanding, I plan to implement a bare bones OS. I'll be following the [University of Birmingham's Guide](https://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/~exr/lectures/opsys/10_11/lectures/os-dev.pdf)e and referring to [this GitHub repo](https://github.com/cfenollosa/os-tutorial/tree/master).


## By the way, 
**lzOS** stands for Led Zeppelin Operating System. Big [LZ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Led_Zeppelin) fan!
